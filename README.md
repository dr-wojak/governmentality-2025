## Governmentality 2025

*A Public Record of Governance, Preparedness, and Decision-Making in Ireland*

---

## Overview

**Governmentality 2025** is a publicly accessible evidential repository preserving a snapshot of the Irish State’s governance record during the period **2008–2025**. The repository documents a multi-decade failure to engage with **Operations Research (O.R.)**—a discipline essential for lawful decision-making under uncertainty in defence, public health, and national infrastructure.

## The Canon (Primary Repository Links)

What began as a technical proposal matured, through repeated notice and non-response, into a **structural indictment** of institutional evasion, designed delay, and the systematic suppression of applied intelligence.

## Status

This repository is a **historical snapshot of 2025**. It is preserved as a fixed public record to prevent retroactive dilution, revision, or narrative laundering.

*The repository shifts the burden of proof to the State, treating pervasive and self-preserving non-responsiveness as the primary breach of fiduciary and decision-making duty.*
