# Governmentality 2025

*A Public Record of Governance, Preparedness, and Decision-Making in Ireland*

## Overview

**Governmentality 2025** is a publicly accessible evidential repository preserving a snapshot of the Irish State’s governance record during the period 2008–2025. The repository documents a "multi-decade failure" to engage with **Operations Research (O.R.)**—a discipline essential for managing decision-making under risk in defense, health, and national infrastructure. What began as a technical proposal has matured into a "structural indictment" of institutional evasion and the suppression of applied intelligence.

## Legal Footnotes and Authorities

The repository is grounded in the following statutory and constitutional pillars, which define the "fiduciary duty" and "decision duty" of the State:

1. 
**Constitutional Obligations**: The right to petition Parliament under **Article 15.10** and the executive authority vested in the Government under **Article 28** of *Bunreacht na hÉireann*.


2. 
**Ethics in Public Office Act 1995**: Specifically **Section 8(2)** regarding complaints against members and **Section 8(3)** regarding statutory duties of disclosure and ethical conduct.


3. 
**Standing Orders**: Dáil Standing Order **162(3)(d)** and Seanad Standing Order **145(3)(d)**, which govern the receipt and processing of formal complaints regarding member conduct.


4. 
**Administrative Law**: The **Ministers and Secretaries Acts** and the **Cabinet Handbook**, which articulate the collective responsibility of Cabinet and the duty of oversight in national preparedness.


5. 
**Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013**: Cited as the mechanism to compel the discharge of statutory duties where maladministration is established.


6. 
**Good Administration**: Derived from EU principles, requiring "substantive acknowledgment" of expert submissions rather than "simulated process" or "formulaic responses".

## Status

This repository is a **historical snapshot of 2025**. It is preserved as a fixed record to prevent the retroactive dilution of the evidential trail.

---

This repository shifts the burden of proof to the State, treating the "design" of non-responsiveness as the primary breach of fiduciary duty.
